# Heroes of the Storm Hero Builder
### *Build your own Heroes of the Storm hero*

## Overview

This is a hero builder for the "Heroes of the Storm" game from Blizzard. With it you can use the template provided to build your own hero concept. It will provide the following:

* The ability to create basic abilites, heroic abilites and side abilites for a hero.
* Stats for heroes and provide the calculations for when the hero is levelled up.
* Similar to the above also provide calculations for level modifiers for abilities and damage.
