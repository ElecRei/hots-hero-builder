# Heroes of the Storm Hero Builder
### *Build your own Heroes of the Storm hero*

## Overview

This is a hero builder for the "Heroes of the Storm" game from Blizzard. With it you can use the template provided to build your own hero concept. It will provide the following:

* The ability to create basic abilites, heroic abilites and side abilites for a hero.
* Stats for heroes and provide the calculations for when the hero is levelled up.
* Similar to the above also provide calculations for level modifiers for abilities and damage.
* A UI similar to the game interface, along with the ability to add images for your hero and abilities.

## Current Progress

Currently working on building the layout for the Hero Builder itself. This will include for now a basic form and output area similar to the sandbox. Unlike the sandbox though this form will include all the stats/values necessary for a hero ([Heroes of the Storm Wiki - Statistics](https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/Statistics)) and then calculate the values for you. For now it's going to be pretty simple. :grin:
