# Heroes of the Storm Hero Builder
### *Build your own Heroes of the Storm hero*

## Overview

This is a hero builder for the "Heroes of the Storm" game from Blizzard. With it you can use the template provided to build your own hero concept. It will provide the following:

* The ability to create basic abilites, heroic abilites and side abilites for a hero.
* Stats for heroes and provide the calculations for when the hero is levelled up.
* Similar to the above also provide calculations for level modifiers for abilities and damage.
* A UI similar to the game interface, along with the ability to add images for your hero and abilities.

## Current Progress

Currently working on the Hero Builder and fixing up any issues with the form. Next steps include building a proper output area for values, adding ability areas and tidying up the form a bit.

**Update - 04/23/19**

I'm going to be starting a new project for organzing this repo and getting it a bit more refined. The overall reason why is because I noticed when I had four different branches that were branches from other branches it got a bit confusing to navigate everything. So I'm going to try to update the README, make a wiki and get a site going for this project.

Below is a brief to-do list for the week that is updated weekly:

#### Weekly To-do's for the week of *April 21st - 27th*

* Start building Hero Builder page
  * Build necessary form with required fields
  * Check for any issues and fix them related to form
  * Create proper output area for values
  * Update form styling
* Update Sandbox
  * Look into other formulas needed and include other operations for some formulas (i.e. subtract a percentage from a value)
* Flesh out the repo a bit more
