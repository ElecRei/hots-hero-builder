# Heroes of the Storm Hero Builder
### *Build your own Heroes of the Storm hero*

## Overview

This is a hero builder for the "Heroes of the Storm" game from Blizzard. With it you can use the template provided to build your own hero concept. It will provide the following:

* The ability to create basic abilites, heroic abilites and side abilites for a hero.
* Stats for heroes and provide the calculations for when the hero is levelled up.
* Similar to the above also provide calculations for level modifiers for abilities and damage.
* A UI similar to the game interface, along with the ability to add images for your hero and abilities.

## Current Progress

Good morning everyone, it's been while since I've updated the README for HotS Hero Builder so that's what I'm doing right now. Currently I have gone back to work on the sandbox to get all the formulas I need out of the way before continuing one with the builder proper. That way there's less back and forth between the two areas.

Below is a brief to-do list for the week that is updated weekly:

#### Weekly To-do's for the week of *May 12th - May 18th*

* Update Sandbox
  * Look into other formulas needed and include other operations for some formulas (i.e. subtract a percentage from a value)
  * Redo sandbox to include:
    * Multiple calculators with their own outputs
    * Consider multiple variations for formulas (i.e. subtracting percentages in contrast to adding them)
    * Offer custom formula building
